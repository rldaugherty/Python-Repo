# Python offers a shorthand for updating variables. When you have a number saved in a variable and want to add to the current value of the variable, you can use the += (plus-equals) operator.

total_price = 0

new_sneakers = 50.00

#You can use the "+=" operator to update the variable value instead of constantly writing variable = variable + new_amount
total_price += new_sneakers

nice_sweater = 39.00
total_price += nice_sweater

fun_books = 20.00
total_price += fun_books
# Update total_price here:

print("The total price is", total_price)
